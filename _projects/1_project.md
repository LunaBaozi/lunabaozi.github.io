## ENGLISH VERSION

### Introduction
Hi! By reading this post I assume that you're already comfortable with the idea of questioning yourself (?) on your ideas about feminism and patriarchy. 
Are you thinking "Yet another bitch writing about non-existent problems" or "Your body, my choice" or even (without particular depth of though) "BULLSHIT"? Well, then I warly invite you to get the fuck out of this blog asap. Never visit it again. 
Unfortunately, despite being a firm believer that talking solves everything, I'm also a firm believer that talking to people who don't want to listen is a waste of time and energies.  
Are you staying instead? Welcome then! I'm really happy you're here. I hope by reading this post you can discover a few new things and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback about it. Let's start!

Feminism is a complex matter that spans decades (?). We live a in a patriarchal society and most people are still victim of the retaggio of believing that men and women are different. And even worse, that there can only be men and women. But intersex, trans and non-binary people are a real reality BREAKING NEWS.

With this blog post, I would like to outline one of the many possible strategies that you can adopt to start informing yourself about feminism. I love reading, so I compiled a list of books that could help you complete some "steps" into becoming more aware about the matter.

### Dive in!

Step 1: feminism masked as a black humour bubbly story
a great story that also makes you feel uncomfortable
Objective of step 1: realise how deep the patriarchal society is rooted and that women experience sexism every day of their lives.

Tea Hacic-Vlahovic is a Croatian-American writer, columnist and podcast host. I've been following her content for years, ever since one of my best friends showed me one of her early skits posted on TikTok (link of pregnant pasta vodka). She talks about feminism in a refreshing way, without bothering with theory or weighting her words to be "taken seriously" by the male audience. She calls herself Mamma Troia (in italian, Mother Whore), and we're all proudly her Troie Radicali (in italian, Radical Whores). 
The book follows the life of Mia, a fashion student at accademia di Milano (?). She struggles with toxic relationships in all aspects of life: friendships, romantic relationships, food, work, study. 
What's great about the book, in my opinion, is that it actually discusses very serious topics in a sort of conceiled way. You keep reading, laughing a lot of times, but the sense of discomfort grows in you and leaves your mouth bitter.
It has all of the glamourizing shit typical of Hollywood, but the fact that the distinction between the main character and the author is blurred, makes you think twice and really consider the matter as a serious one.

Tea has also published a second book, called "A Cigarette Lit Backwards", which is more mature and less raw than "Life of the Party". I recommend reading that one as a follow-up too.

Objective achieved? Let's move on then! 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: only because it's a short one, but this is actually crazy
SCUM Manifesto, Valerie Solanas

Valerie Solanas was an American radical feminism and writer, become unfortunately famous for attempting to kill Andy Warhol.

I remember reading the manifesto for the first time in high school, probably, and it stuck with me ever since. It's so outrageously mental that it completely makes sense.

Objective of step 1: realise how deep the patriarchal society is rooted and that women experience sexism every day of their lives.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: informing yourself about intersectional feminism and trans theory

Countersexual manifesto, Paul Preciado

I attended one of his talks at the Internazionale Festival in Ferrara (Italy) back in 2019 (?) and I remember it being a complete disaster: Paul spoke in Spanish, and he was assigned a translator who was 100% clueless about the topics he was talking about (trans theory, sex, Sant'Agostino). She was a very polite middle aged woman, super embarassed because she couldn't keep up with the speaker's speed nor content, and struggled incredibly to translate; so much that, at some point, Paul even had to interrupt her to correct her translation, which completely changed the meaning of what Paul was saying (Italian and Spanish are quite close languages and can roughly understand each other). The audience broke in a hearty laugh and the talk continued. 

Objective of step 1: realise how deep the patriarchal society is rooted and that women experience sexism every day of their lives.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: realising how deep the reality of patriarchy is in our society

Girl, Woman, Other, Bernardine Evaristo

My super knowledgeable Gender Studies PhD flatmate recommended me to read this book, among many others. It quickly became one of my all-time favourites and I couldn't resist gifting it to my best friend. It's long and painful, excruciating, but so well-written that it lits a sincere anger within you that propels you to make efforts to change something.
It's a collection of short stories following the lives of black women based in the UK.

Objective of step 1: realise how deep the patriarchal society is rooted and that women experience sexism every day of their lives.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: going further: overturning the role of nature and machines

Xenofeminism, Helen Hester

When I bought Xenofeminism in the beautiful Nero Editions at the bookshop during my Bachelor years in Bologna I felt super rich. When I first read it, I couldn't really understand what it was talking about, but nevertheless, I tought that some aspects of it tipped me over the edge of some thoughts that I hadn't fully formed yet. For certain aspects, it seemed to give life to some of the things I was thinking about the role of women in reproduction and the "naturality" of it all.
I'm also a big fan of Boston Dynamics's robots, they are absolutely fantastic. Who knows, maybe someday I'll abandon drug discovery to make research on robots.

Objective of step 1: realise how deep the patriarchal society is rooted and that women experience sexism every day of their lives.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: wrapping everything up

We should all be feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie


Objective of step 1: realise how deep the patriarchal society is rooted and that women experience sexism every day of their lives.



Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    ---
    layout: page
    title: project
    description: a project with a background image
    img: /assets/img/12.jpg
    ---

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/5.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
