## ENGLISH VERSION

### Introduction
Hello! By reading this post I assume that you're already comfortable with the idea of questioning yourself (?) on your ideas about feminism and patriarchy. 
Are you thinking "Yet another bitch writing about non-existent problems" or "Your body, my choice" or even (without particular depth of though) "BULLSHIT"? Well, then I warly invite you to get the fuck out of this blog asap. Never visit it again. 
Unfortunately, despite being a firm believer that talking solves everything, I'm also a firm believer that talking to people who don't want to listen is a waste of time and energies.  
Are you staying instead? Welcome then! I'm really happy you're here. I hope by reading this post you can discover a few new things and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback about it. Let's start!

Feminism is a complex matter that spans decades (?). We live a in a patriarchal society and most people are still victim of the retaggio of believing that men and women are different. And even worse, that there can only be men and women. But intersex, trans and non-binary people are a real reality BREAKING NEWS.

With this blog post, I would like to outline one of the many possible strategies that you can adopt to start informing yourself about feminism. I love reading, so I compiled a list of books that could help you complete some "steps" into becoming more aware about the matter.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
