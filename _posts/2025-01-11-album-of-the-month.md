## 2025

### January - Club Inferno, Domiziana
Domiziana is the first artist making German music I came across. I love her character and her music. She has Italian origins, so it's fun hearing the German/Italian/English mix in her songs. By learning by heart some parts of her songs, my German has dramatically improved too (and by dramatically I mean I now know around 50 words more than before...). This club tape is a no-skip, short album, for when I need a bit of help in the motivation department.

## 2024

### December - Another Mind, Hiromi
Started listening to Hiromi towards the end of 2024, and spent a few weeks completely immersed in her music. Her first album, Another Mind, is a constant source of wonder, and every time I listen to it, it fills me up with energy and motivation. I must have talked a lot about her music during the autumn season, because someone dear to me decided to surprise me with this album in physical form, which was the best birthday gift ever.

### May - LOVE ALL SERVE ALL, Fujii Kaze    
### April 
### March - IN LIFE, Stray Kids
I started listening to K-pop somewhere in 2020, but discovered Stray Kids only in early 2024. Safe to say, I liked their music, and listened to their albums a whole lot during the first few months of 2024. They have a quite interesting discography, spanning mixes of K-pop with many other genres. Their music and content entertained me for basically 99% of my awake time in March. All time favourite song by them is Miroh, but most listened to album in March was probably IN LIFE: it contains many of their hits, and it's a very pleasant album to listen to if you want to shut your thoughts off for a good while.
