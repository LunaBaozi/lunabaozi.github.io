Ciao! I'm Luna, and I'm the creator of this blog :sparkles:

You can find bits and pieces of information about me all over the pages, so I'll just use this space to say that I love animals (I'm a cat person), chinese food, wearing skirts and my favourite colour is red. Thanks for visiting the blog and I hope you'll enjoy reading the posts!

My representative emoji is the jiaozi :dumpling:
